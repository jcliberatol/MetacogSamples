		<h2>The Story</h2>
		<p>Liz ran across the classroom's door as soon as the bell started to ring. She was really exited! that day Dad had promised her to be at the School's door early than the usual, and then they would go to the Zoo. Liz's eyes opened wide just thinking about the giant elephants, hers favorite animals, and a big smile made hers face shine.</p>
		<p>But once she arrived to the door, hers smile vanished. Dad was not there! after a moment of confusion, anger changed hers face: "He forgot it!" she thought. "he forgot his promise!"</p>
		<p>But then she said to herself: "and what if something bad happened to him?" she looked worried, and sad for being furious thinking that he had forgotten the visit to the zoo while maybe he was in some serious trouble.</p>
		<p>Tears started to appear in hers eyes, but then a familiar voice said "Everything is OK, liz?".</p>
		<p>With a soft smile, Liz said "Now everything is OK, Dad".</p>
